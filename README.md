# EcommPipelineandAnalysis


📌 Project Overview

This project implements a real-time data pipeline for processing e-commerce orders using Databricks, Delta Lake, and Structured Streaming.
It follows the Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold) with data quality checks and Unity Catalog governance to enable real-time analytics and dashboards.

🚀 Architecture

Data Source: Simulated real-time orders using Faker scripts

Ingestion: Databricks Auto Loader for incremental streaming ingestion

Processing: Structured Streaming with Bronze, Silver, and Gold Delta tables

Governance: Unity Catalog for fine-grained security and auditing

Analytics: Databricks SQL for interactive dashboards and reporting
